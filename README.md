# ADatME
An App that displays manufacturer's ads for items I am thinking about buying.

Ok, so let's say I want to buy a lawnmower.
There are many manufacturers that want you to buy their product.
The app ADatME, will allow manufacturers the chance to show you why you want to buy their product.
Each time to "watch" an AD, you are given something for your time.
A REWARD for watching.
The manufacturer, the "MAN", will need to know several things before they present you with an AD.
In this case; size of lawn, sitdown mower versus push or self propel, electric versus gas, grass catcher versus mulcher. 
These questions and answers go into your PROFILE.
You need to create a PROFILE, if you want the REWARD. 
The REWARD is only for the person who watched the AD, it is not transferable.
If someone wanted to learn about lawnmowers and did not want a REWARD, they could sign in as a GUEST USER.
Part of the give and take of this app is the demographic information the MAN receives.
After watching several ADs, you decide which lawnmower is best for you and you go to buy it, the REWARD is applied to your purchase.
The REWARD would be stored in the app and sent to your wallet in the form of a scanable code.

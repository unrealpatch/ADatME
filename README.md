# ADatME
An App that displays manufacturer's ads for items I am thinking about buying.

Ok, so let's say I want to buy a lawnmower.
There are many manufacturers that want you to buy their product.
The app ADatME, will allow manufacturers the chance to show you why you want to buy their product.
Each time to "watch" an AD, you are given something for your time.
A REWARD for watching.
The manufacturer, the "MAN", will need to know several things before they present you with an AD.
In this case; size of lawn, sitdown mower versus push or self propel, electric versus gas. 
These questions and answers go into your PROFILE.
You need to create a PROFILE, if you want the REWARD. 
The REWARD is only for the person who watched the AD, it is not transferable.
If someone wanted to learn about lawnmowers and did not want a REWARD, they could sign in as a GUEST USER.
Part of the give and take of this app is the demographic information the MAN receives.
After watching several ADs, you decide which lawnmower is best for you and you go to buy it, the REWARD is applied to your purchase.
The REWARD would be stored in the app and sent to your wallet in the form of a scanable code.
Once a REWARD is used, the app is updated, and all MANs are provided information about the users choice, and the matter is closed.
There will be no more "prompting" from the MANs.
The PROFILE is information about the user.
AGE, SEX, etcetera.
Part of a PROFILE may be the users likes and dislikes.
For instance, the user does not like fish, or the user likes Honda Motors.
It is not necessary for the user to list likes and dislikes. 
Part of the app programing will glean likes and dislikes from questions asked when the users is looking for product info.
Here is an example of how infomation will be gleaned. 
When the user purchases the lawnmower; Will the user pay with cash, check, or credit / debit.
The info gleaned shows, the user has credit or a bank or cash.
Other information that is gleaned in the complete back ground, such as the type of mobile device they use.
All information is stored for the MAN to offer REWARDS in turn for the users attention.
If the user buy a gas mower, maybe a gas station can offer a REWARD for using their station.
Maybe service providers, in the user's neighborhood can offer a REWARD for seasonal maintenance on the user's mower.
Bottom line, the PROFILE helps build true and valuable information for both the MAN and the USER.
